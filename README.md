Task 1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning In this regression task I tried to predict of marks that a students is expected to score based upon the numbers of hours they studied. 
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. 
Technical Stack : Sikit Learn, Numpy Array, Pandas, Matplotlib




Task 2: Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
In this task we will try to find out weak areas where we can work to make the profit.
Steps to be followed
1.Importing the libraries
2. Reading the Dataset
3. Data Preproccessing
4 EDA
5. Data Visualization
